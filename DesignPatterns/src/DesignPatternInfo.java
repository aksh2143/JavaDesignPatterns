	 * 	1. They are already approved, and gives a standard approach to provide industry problems, saves time.
	 * 	2. They offer re-usability and hence make system robust and highly maintainable code, etc.

	/**
	 * 1. Creational :
	 * -> These design patterns, as the name suggests, provides a way for object creation and class instantiation
	 *    in a best possible way for some problems.
	 * 
	 * -> Suppose you develop an application and you need a database connection. For that, you will need in create an instance
	 * of JDBCDriver class, which will create a connection to database and you will use it for your DB operation. Now, if you
	 * need to do such operations in 5 different classes, than you need that connection at 5 places. So you need to make sure
	 * that you do not create 5 different connection to database. For that you need to implement Singleton pattern,
	 * which allows to create only one instance of the class and so we have to use same DB connection object in all places.
